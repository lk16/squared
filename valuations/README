This directory is used to store possible valuations for bot_ali. A valuation 
tells ali "how much" he should try to get a field. The board is divided in 10
field classes, and a valuation file specifies for each class how desirable it 
is.

Without further ado, these are the classes:

  0,1,2,3,3,2,1,0,
  1,4,5,6,6,5,4,1,
  2,5,7,8,8,7,5,2
  3,6,8,9,9,8,6,3,
  3,6,8,9,9,8,6,3,
  2,5,7,8,8,7,5,2
  1,4,5,6,6,5,4,1,
  0,1,2,3,3,2,1,0


There are 19 classes, here counted from 0 to 9. This means that your valuation
file should have 10 whitespace seperated integers. Note that negative integeres
are allowed. 

Also note that the bot 'merely' tries to maximise the sum of the valuations for
the fields it has minus the sum of those of its oponent.

As of June 2014 comments in valuation files have not been implemented.
